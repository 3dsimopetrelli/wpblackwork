# Architecture Summary: wpblackwork

## Overview
**wpblackwork** (BW Elementor Widgets) is a comprehensive modular WordPress plugin designed to customize the **BlackWork** site. It serves as a central hub for custom Elementor widgets, WooCommerce enhancements, and specific site functionality.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Modular Structure
The plugin is organized into distinct submodules, loaded by the main file `bw-main-elementor-widgets.php`.
- **Widgets System**: Automates Elementor widget registration via `includes/class-bw-widget-loader.php`.
- **Submodules**:
  - `BW_coming_soon/`: Full-page coming soon mode.
  - `cart-popup/`: AJAX-powered side-cart.
  - `admin/`: Unified settings via `class-blackwork-site-settings.php`.

### 2. Elementor Widgets
Widgets are auto-discovered from `includes/widgets/`. Key widgets include:
- **Sliders**: `BW_Slick_Slider_Widget`, `BW_Product_Slide_Widget`, `BW_Presentation_Slide_Widget`.
- **Content Walls**: `BW_Filtered_Post_Wall_Widget`, `BW_Wallpost_Widget`.
- **Commerce**: `BW_Related_Products_Widget`, `BW_Add_To_Cart_Variation_Widget`.

### 3. WooCommerce Customizations
Extensive overrides located in `woocommerce/` and `includes/product-types/`:
- **Custom Product Types**:
  - `Digital Assets`: Virtual/Downloadable with specific metadata.
  - `Books`: Physical products with bibliographic details.
  - `Prints`: Art prints with framing options.
- **Template Overrides**:
  - Custom Checkout (Two-column layout).
  - Custom My Account (Social login, dashboard redesign).
- **Metaboxes**: Custom fields for products managed in `metabox/`.

### 4. Asset Management
- **Smart Loading**: Assets are registered on `init` but enqueued only when widgets are used on the page.
- **Versioning**: Uses `filemtime()` for automatic cache busting.
- **Organization**: CSS/JS files are paired with their respective widgets in `assets/`.

### 5. Technical Stack
- **Dependencies**: Elementor, WooCommerce, Slick Carousel (CDN).
- **Libraries**: Uses native WordPress Masonry and jQuery.
- **AJAX**: Custom endpoints for Live Search and Filtered Walls.

## Development Workflow
- **Adding Widgets**: Create `class-bw-{name}-widget.php` in `includes/widgets/` -> Auto-registered.
- **Styling**: `assets/css/` directory.
- **Logic**: Shared helpers in `includes/helpers.php`.
